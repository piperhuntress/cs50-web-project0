# Project 0 - Jasmin Tumulak Estudillo - June 12, 2020

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project 0 is a website about myself. It utilizes Boostrap components(navigation, carousel, cards to name a few). 
Implemented: SCSS variables, nesting and inheritance.

Brief content of each page:
index.html - contains short description about myself.
personal.htm - page with images of my family, husband and dogs. Uses Boostrap cards compent to layout the images and Bootstrap tables to display favorite food.
travel.htm - page which uses carousel to display different images from a few of my travels. Uses unordered list for listing the different countries travelled.
places.htm - page about the place where I am currently working and uses Bootstrap cards to layout the images.
